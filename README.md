# Unity-Random-State-Machine
A simple finite state machine. The project contains a scene where an enemy will switch between three states: patrol, wander and chase. The enemy will also drop coins at random intervals that the player can pick up. This is only a prototype for a state machine design pattern, and not necessarily a part of any game.
